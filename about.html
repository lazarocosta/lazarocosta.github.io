I have completed my Master’s degree in Informatics Engineering in 2019 at Faculty of Engineering at University of Porto (FEUP). During my Masters degree, I developed a plugin for the Dendro Platform improving the data management, share and reuse of research data.

Since then I have conducted research related to storage, share, reproducibility, and data representation. During the following two years, I was part of the research team of the “EPISA - Entity and Property Inference for Semantic Archives” (DSAIPA/DS/0023/2018) project, where I was responsible for implementing the representations of the digital archives of the "Torre do Tombo". Since 2019 I am also an Invited Assistant Professor at FEUP teaching courses on databases and compiler construction.

Currently, I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Engineering at University of Porto and a member of the research center HASLab/INESC TEC. The goal of my PhD is to improve reproducibility, reusability and collaboration in the research domain.
